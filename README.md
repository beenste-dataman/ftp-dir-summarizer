The FTP Server Summary tool is a Python script that provides a comprehensive summary and visual analysis of files and directories within an FTP server directory. The tool takes a directory path as input and generates useful statistics such as the total file count, total directory count, and summary statistics for file sizes. It also creates informative visualizations including a time series graph of file modification times, a bar graph showing the number of files owned by each user, and a bar graph displaying the count of files by file type. The tool utilizes popular Python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Jinja2 to process the data, generate visualizations, and produce an HTML report that can be easily viewed and shared. It provides valuable insights into the FTP server contents, facilitating better understanding and analysis of the files and directories within the server.
